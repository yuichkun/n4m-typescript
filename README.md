# Node for Max TypeScript Boilerplate 

A boilerplate of using TypeScript in Node for Max.

## Features

This boilerplate expects two use-cases.

- `ts-node` mode
  - runs the code on-the-fly **without** dumping `.js` files out
  - fast to **boot up**
  - recommended for development
- `javascript` mode
  - transpiles the code with `tsc` and then execute the dumped `.js` files
  - fast to **execute**  

And, in both modes, basic types for Node.js core modules and `MaxAPI` are already included.
